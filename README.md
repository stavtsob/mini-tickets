## The Problem

There are a lot of applications that focus on large scale team management, with a bunch of features, complex mechanisms etc. The problem comes when small teams or organizations try to use such applications. The complexity and the UI is so generic and complex, that it makes simple task management and team comunication difficult to handle.

## Our Solution

Mini Tickets is a minimal way to handle your tasks effectively, inside a friendly application enviroment. We tried to implement the best and more usefull features of the most common task management applications, in a way that the users of the application can manage their tasks quickly and effectively. We tried to make an application fully customizable to your team needs.
## Technical Information

The Mini Tickets project is a Laravel Web Application, using some of the known Laravel packages and Laravel Mix.
Feel free to fork the project and contribute to it.
